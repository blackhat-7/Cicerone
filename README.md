Travelling is passion for many. It’s a great way to explore new places and new things.

But there is a problem faced by many tourists. Whenever we are in a new place, we don’t have much idea about the place. We may not have a tour guide available with us at all times.

So what we need is a personal guide which can give us the information we need and is with us at all times. 
Thus, we have come up with an application called “Cicerone” which will act as your personal guide and identify the places and describe them.

Provided any of the below inputs:
  Picture of the Point of Interest
  Location of the Point of Interest
  A sign board denoting the Point of Interest
We can provide you with the Name and About the POI you are interested in!

## How to run
- clone the repo
- ```python first.py```
